## Setup
1. Set up your environment. I use GitBash with VSCode for this. You'll also want MySql Workbench installed.
2. Install .NET https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0 get .NET SDK 5.0.408
3. Clone this repo by entering into GitBash 'git clone https://github.com/ElliotMcGonigal/VendorOrder.Solution'
4. In the terminal, navigate to the file you just cloned.
5. Create an 'appsettings.json' file in the HairSalon directory. It should look like the following: 
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[YOUR DATABASE NAME HERE];uid=[YOUR USER ID HERE];pwd=[YOUR PASSWORD HERE];"
  }
}
6. Have mysql server running and open mysql workbench
7. Import the sql data into the workbench (the sql data is located in the main project file)
8. Enter 'dotnet build' into the terminal
9. Enter 'dotnet run' into the terminal
10. Now open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000/ and explore!
